What Changes When You Switch Platform?
The tutorial can show examples for GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

The Git commands are mostly the same, but some steps (like connecting to a remote or pushing code) might look a little different depending on the platform you choose.

Use the menu to see examples for each platform.
